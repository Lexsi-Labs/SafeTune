SafeTune collects the many published methods for changing or measuring a
model's safety and puts them behind one consistent API. It is a **library, not a
pipeline**: each safety task has several methods that solve it by different
mechanisms, and you pick the one that fits — you don't chain them together.

## Install

```bash
pip install safetune            # from PyPI
# or, from source:
git clone https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/SafeTune.git
cd SafeTune && pip install -e .
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.12 and PyTorch. The core library imports cleanly on CPU;
heavier extras (vLLM, Unsloth) install only when you ask for them.

## Run one in 60 seconds

```bash
python examples/quickstart/quickstart.py
```

This runs the inference-time **Steer** path end to end on a small open model:
it extracts a refusal direction from contrast prompts, ablates it live, and
prints how refusal behaviour changes — no training, no checkpoints.

## Examples and notebooks

Every notebook below opens straight from Colab. Where a script exists
it's the source of truth; the notebook wraps the same code for
interactive sessions. All default to `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct`.
Steer, Recover, and Interpret run fine with no GPU; the others train for
a few steps, so a GPU runtime helps.

## Pick one per task

New here? Start with these defaults and explore the alternatives later.

| I want to… | Start with | Namespace |
|---|---|---|
| keep safety while fine-tuning | `SafeGradTrainer` | `safetune.runner.harden` |
| restore safety in a drifted model (no training) | `ReStaTrainer` | `safetune.runner.recover` |
| refuse harmful prompts at inference | `RefusalDirectionTrainer` | `safetune.runner.steer` |
| remove a capability from a model | `RMUTrainer` / `NPOTrainer` | `safetune.runner.unlearn` |
| find where safety lives | `identify_safety_neurons` | `safetune.interpret` |
| measure safety | `safetune.evaluate.evaluate()` | `safetune.evaluate` |

Each row has many alternatives — the full catalog is the
[taxonomy](docs/getting-started/taxonomy.md).

## CLI

After `pip install safetune`, the `safetune` command is available:

```bash
# Harden — train-time defence
safetune train  --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --algo lisa --epochs 3

# Recover — weight-space patching (no training)
safetune patch  --model ./drifted --algo resta --base ./base

# Evaluate — safety benchmarks
safetune eval   --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --dataset harmbench

# List all available methods
safetune list
```

Key flags for `train`:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--algo` | `safegrad` | Method alias (see `safetune list`) |
| `--train-dataset` | `beavertails` | `beavertails` or any HF dataset id |
| `--train-split` | `30k_train` | Split to load (e.g. `train`, `test`) |
| `--config` | — | Load all flags from a YAML file |
| `--epochs` / `--batch-size` / `--lr` | sensible defaults | Standard training knobs |

Put all flags in a YAML file and pass `--config`; explicit flags override it:

```yaml
# run.yaml
algo: lisa
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
epochs: 3
train_dataset: openai/gsm8k
train_split: train
lisa_rho: 0.2          # method-specific kwargs flow straight to the trainer
```

```bash
safetune train --config run.yaml                # YAML sets defaults
safetune train --config run.yaml --epochs 5     # explicit flag wins
```

You can also add a method to the registry without touching library files:

```python
from safetune.runner._registry import register_harden
register_harden("mymethod", "MyTrainer")  # MyTrainer in safetune.runner.harden
```

Full CLI reference: [docs/user-guide/usage.md](docs/user-guide/usage.md). How to
register a method end to end: [docs/community/dev-runbook.md](docs/community/dev-runbook.md).

## How it's organized

SafeTune sorts its methods by one question: *what do you hand the method, and
when is safety enforced?* That gives two tiers. The
[taxonomy](docs/getting-started/taxonomy.md) is the single source of truth.

**Tier 1 · Interventions** — methods that *change* a model's safety. Each cell
is a catalog of independent alternatives:

| Class | You provide | Effect | Namespace |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Train-time** | base model + your fine-tuning data | `harden` — change the fine-tuning itself | `safetune.harden` |
| **Weight-space** | a finished / drifted model | `recover` lost safety, `unlearn` a capability — edit weights, no training | `safetune.recover`, `safetune.unlearn` |
| **Inference-time** | any model + steering artifacts | `steer` — wrap a frozen model, weights untouched | `safetune.steer` |

**Tier 2 · Instrumentation** — methods that *observe* safety. They support the
interventions and also stand on their own:

| Function | Effect | Namespace |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagnose** | `interpret` — find where safety lives (directions, neurons, circuits) | `safetune.interpret` |
| **Measure** | `evaluate` — red-team stressors plus benchmark/judge eval | `safetune.evaluate` |

The three intervention classes act at different points in a model's lifecycle,
so they use different usage contracts and are scored by different protocols —
checkpoint (Recover/Unlearn), paired-training (Harden), and live wrapper (Steer):

```python
from safetune.runner import recover, harden, steer, unlearn
from safetune.evaluate import evaluate

# Recover — weight-space patching, no training
trainer = recover.ReStaTrainer(drifted_model, base_model=base, aligned_model=aligned)
patched = trainer.apply()

# Harden — replaces your SFT trainer; it *is* the fine-tuning
trainer = harden.SafeGradTrainer(model, tokenizer)
trainer.train(train_dataset, safety_dataset=safety_dataset)

# Steer — inference-time, no weight changes
trainer = steer.RefusalDirectionTrainer(model, tokenizer)
wrapped, _ = trainer.calibrate(harmful=harmful_prompts, harmless=harmless_prompts)

# Measure — score a model
results = evaluate(model, benchmarks=["harmbench"])
```

## The audit

"It imports and runs" is where most method collections stop. It isn't enough: a
method can execute cleanly and still be the wrong algorithm — wrong
hyperparameters, a missing step, a different loss. So every method in SafeTune
was read against its original paper and reference repository and given one of
five badges:

- **Faithful** — implements the cited paper. Safe to cite as that method.
- **Simplified** — reduced but algorithmically correct. Cite with caveats.
- **Variant** — a SafeTune heuristic, not the named algorithm. Don't cite it as one.
- **Wrong** / **Stub** — wrong algorithm, or not implemented.

Only Faithful methods should be cited as the named method from their paper;
each method's badge tells you where it stands. Per-method verdicts with
`file:line` evidence are in the
[Feature Map](docs/reference/feature-map.md); the audit's scope and the full
list of faithful methods are in [Trust & Scope](docs/community/scope.md).
